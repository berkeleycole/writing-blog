      <div>
        Bombarded walls and shattered glass  <br />
        Martyred place of worship <br />
          your remnants share a gospel <br />
          no bell nor steeple ever told.  <br />
        Humbled cathedral <br />
          famous not for stone or art <br />
          but for testimony  <br />
          of Christian hope  <br />
          forgiveness undaunted  <br />
          a chance of renewal.  <br />
        Sepulchral church  <br />
          your saintly bones we keep  <br />
          near us  <br />
          imbue us with the miracle  <br />
          reconciliation that we seek. <br />
        Blessed ruin
          you stand and ever faceless cry  <br />
          the tears our hatred cannot shed  <br />
          burnt beams voiceless raise our plea  <br />
          for a divine humanity.  <br />
