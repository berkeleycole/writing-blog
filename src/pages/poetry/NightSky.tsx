        We will reach up into this<br />
        deep wide night sky<br />
        push our fingers through<br />
        up to our elbows<br />
        feeling for stars and galaxies<br />
        ball it up<br />
        sticky black and moist<br />
        gritty between our palms<br />
        we could not resist<br />
        we would rub it on our faces<br />
        over every inch<br />
        it leaves a tingle of eternity<br />
        as bare skin meets horizonless dark<br />
        we were covered<br />
        immersed<br />
        in this thick night sky<br />
        and who says we will ever come back?<br />
        we'll make new figures in the stars
