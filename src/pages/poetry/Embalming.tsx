      <h1>An embalming</h1>

      <p> My organs were being embalmed </p>
      <p> And though she spoke to me </p>
      <p> Of grandmothers and family stories </p>
      <p> I could not be at ease </p>
      <p> My heart I should have calmed </p>
      <p> Was unnervingly still </p>
      <p> Marinating unceremoniously </p>
      <p> They were my organs after all </p>
      <p> We'd done so much together </p>
      <p> A stab of loyalty went through me  </p>
      <p> As if each were friends, so dependable </p>
      <p> Yet I did not even recognize them </p>
      <p> Ladled around in bowls </p>
      <p> And as I lay on the embalming table </p>
      <p> I felt such nostalgia and attachment </p>
      <p> For each item in that soupy mixture </p>
      <p> To feel such a bond </p>
      <p> To things I had never seen </p>
      <p> Was an odd feeling </p>

      <p>-- Drafted May 25, 2022. Literally had a dream where I was on an embalming table looking at my heart, woke up with a physical emotional feeling for my organs. It was .. quite strange</p>
