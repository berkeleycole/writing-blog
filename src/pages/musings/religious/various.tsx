        <h3>Note</h3>
        <p>
          These musings are, for the most part, Christian of the generically evangelical sort. If that's not your jam, 
          skip these. Also, views change over time, certainly my own, and some of these are old and might not 
          reflect or adequately explain my beliefs of the present moment.

      <h2>.....What is the gospel</h2>

      <p>
        It is hearing someone whisper 
        "What you've hoped and fleeting felt is true, the better things, the deep things, ARE real".
        What you hear in the music without words that stirs you; what you sense in those moments when you feel elevated, and know it is feeling alive,
        That IS what you were made for, life can have those colors.
        Come, be willing to see god behind the world, god in your life. 
        Consider the idea of greater truth, a design for the world, and let it free you of the need to pretend that what is here is enough. It is not. 
        The world we have made is flat, and there is a world of wonder to be discovered. 
        You will not lose the world, you will see it for what it is, and gain the world you were meant for.

        We search the world and all our human capacities, and every world of fancy, for meaning, magic, and mission. 
        A place to stand out, a part to be played uniquely by us. 

        And we have known, 
        - been sure of but not dared to hope - 
        that we could find a story,
        One that would envelope us,
        But also have a place for us
        And that there is indeed
        magic to this world,
        that there is a grand and dangerous
        adventure playing out
        That is in our bones and blood to join
        You will not come out unscathed
        But it will be worth it
      </p>

      <h2>....Christ growing in grace with god</h2>

      <p>
        Christ as the word, the evolution of the trinity and Christ became man. The idea that Christ has been the embodiment and light of god to mankind throughout our entire existence, sometimes as words, sometimes as fire, as a voice, as wind, and as a man. 

        So, what should I know him as? Do I talk to god and imagine the man? I can picture the fire, i can sense the wind and can see god in them. I say he, but I will know him as so much more than that. When I think of the representation of god to man, it is helpful to think of all the forms, and all the forms of god that can speak to me still.

      <h2>... on creation and my part in the mess of things</h2>

      All I can do is look at a tree and say, "I am sorry", because before humanity fucked everything up, it was perfect. It was actually perfect. God looked at it all and gave a stamp of approval. Animals got along, disease, death, hardship, and dissension did not exist. Needs did not exist. Whether I think the whole Adam and Eve thing is history or ancient narrative, i do have to believe that everything god makes is perfect, and when humanity chose sin, I have to then infer that our decision inherently changed the timber of the universe. That we changed the fundamental character of the world, of nature itself, when we chose not god. As being put in a place of responsibility over creation, our sin had an effect on it at a very base level. 

      So I look at a tree, and can only feel an overwhelming and deep-hearted sense of remorse and loss and shame, because for some reason I can grasp the depth of what was lost when I look at what nature is now and what it should be.  And I can start to understand that the same loss is also in me. The tree and I have both fallen, of the two of us - me the farther. I was created to be a steward, to make things better, and I have only made it worse. And I could sit at the trunk of that tree and cry out of shame, and for grief - there is no apology I could give. Were the earth to put me on trial, I would give no defense. 

      And so it happens, that in sharing and admitting my fault in this loss, that I am moved to a place of wholly and entirely (in a more full, all-encompassing sense than those words implies) being in need of grace. It convinces me that not one step I take, no action on my part, could result in goodness, or begin to fulfill my true purpose, except by the grace and power of god.
